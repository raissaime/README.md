Hi there! 😁 My name is Raíssa Aimê and I'm from Manaus, AM Brazil - "Welcome to the jungle babee". 
I've been working as Human Resourses since 2012 and currently I'm a Tech Recruiter freelancer for companies around Brazil. 
In my free time I like to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), go into the wild, to listen to music - God gave Rock n' roll to you (🎵) and I'm a mommy too (Fulltime, not only in the free time hehe) ! 

Would you like to find me?   https://www.linkedin.com/in/raissa-aime/
